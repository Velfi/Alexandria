<h1>You look a little weary, traveller.</h1>
<h2>Why don't you come in and have a seat.</h2>
<p>I wasn't sure I'd have any visitors today.</p>
<p>How's about I tell you a story?</p>
<p>I have one in mind, but if you can think of one you'd like to hear instead, just say so.</p>
<br/>
<p>(If you'd like to hear the story they had in mind, just type 'load story' and press enter. If you'd like to load your own story file, type 'load *your story file*' instead)</p>
<p>If you need some help on how to play, just type 'help' and press enter.</p>
