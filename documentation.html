        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> <a href="/" class="alexandria">Alexandria</a> is a text-adventure engine that runs in the browser. It uses a simnple text parser to interpret commands and it reads from specially formatted JSON files. This guide will teach you how a story JSON file is organized and how to write your own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this guide, I've included examples of plain JSON for perusal as well as many small clarifications. If you see any text among the paragraphs that is colored <abbr title="Red, a primary color.">red</abbr>, try hovering over it to read the note.</p>

        <h2>What is JSON?</h2>
        <p>JSON stands for JavaScript object notation. It's easy to read and write, even if you're not already completely familiar with JavaScript literal notation. Most of it is composed of key / value pairs, but keys can also hold sets of key / value pairs themselves.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you'd like to get a good handle on the basics of how JSON is used, see <a href="http://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/">JSON: What It Is, How It Works, &amp; How to Use It</a>. To get an idea of how it's formatted, see examples <a href="http://json.org/example.html">here</a>. If you'd like help linting (debugging) your JSON, you can google the many formatters and validators available online (I prefer <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">this</a> one, myself.)</p>

        <h2>Anatomy of a story file</h2>
        <h3>This is an example of a simple one-scene story file:</h3>
        <pre>
<code>
"scene0": {
  "html": "This is where you put the description of a scene, formatted in
           HTML.",

  "events": {
    "event0": "This is an event."
  },

  "moves": {
    "east": "scene1" },

  "objects": {
    "torch": {
    "name": "torch",
    "description": "Some oil-soaked cloth wrapped around a stick. You could
                    light it if you had a source of <b>fire</b>.",
    "is_unique": "true",
    "is_usable": "true",
    "is_takeable": "true",
    "take_message": "You grab the <b>torch</b> and put it in your pack.",
    "on_use": "The torch burns away the <b>cobwebs</b>, revealing a passage" }
  },

  "tag_init": {
    "tag-1": "true", },

  "npc0": {
    "name": "The name you put here is how players will look at or talk to the
             npc. It need not be the NPC's actual name, but should instead be
             one-word descriptor like <b>tiger</b> or <b>woman</b>.",
    "description": "NPC descriptions go here.",
    "dialog": {
      "0": "This is where npc dialog goes."
    }
  }
}</code>
      </pre>
      <h3>Scene basics:</h3>
      <p>At its heart, all a scene really needs to function are a description and a list of possible moves. Scenes are declared in the story file as "<b>scene</b> + <b>a number</b>" (e.g. "scene0, scene1, scene10.") Descriptions should be written as properly tagged HTML, <b>e.g.</b> <abbr title="A paragraph tag.">&lt;p&gt;</abbr>, <abbr title="A heading 1 tag.">&lt;h1&gt;</abbr>, <abbr title="a bold tag.">&lt;b&gt;</abbr>, etc.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When writing scene descriptions, it's good practice to highlight possible command targets for the player. This is done with bold tags <b>e.g.</b> "There is an open door to the &lt;b&gt;<b>east</b>&lt;b&gt;" or "a strange &lt;b&gt;<b>woman</b>&lt;b&gt; sits on a chair on the balcony." This practice ensures that a player will understand their options in a scene. On the other hand, <i>not</i> highlighting an important aspect of a scene can be used as part of a puzzle.</p>
      <div class="ingame">
        <code>In this room is a stone door locked by a strange mechanism. Tiles
              with depictions of animals surround the door on all sides. There
              is an <b>inscription</b> upon the arch of the door.
              <br/> >> look inscription
              <br/>You read the inscription:
              <br/><i>"I walk on four legs and often wear shoes? What am I?"</i>
              <br/> >> use horse tile
              <br/>It seems your answer was correct. The door opens slowly.
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>Beware of using this technique as it can easily leave your player lost if not used skillfully.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Moves are very simple to define. Under the moves property of a scene, a key / value pair must be declared for each possible exit. The key string should be the same as the noun component that you expect a player to enter with the <b>move</b> command. The value of that key should be equal to whichever scene the player should be moved to.<b> For example:</b></p>
      <pre>
<code>Moves: {
  "<b>KEY</b>"  : "<b>VALUE</b>",
  "east" : "scene3",
  "south": "scene4",
  "cave" : "scene2",
  "well" : "scene10"
}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>At this time, move keys must be one word long.</p>
      <h3>Events:</h3>
      <p>Events can serve many purposes, and are triggered by many different things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Looking at an object opens an event with a description of the object.</li>
        <li>Successfully using objects can cause events to occur.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="upcoming">Upcoming event triggers (not yet implemented):</p>
      <ul class="upcoming">
        <li>Events can be triggered by moving to an area.</li>
        <li>Events can be triggered by talking to NPCs.</li>
        <li>Some events can only occur if specific tags are active.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Objects:</h3>
      <!-- <p>Objects can be quite complex and have many properties.</p> -->
      <p>To be added.</p>
