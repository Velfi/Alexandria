A browser based text adventure engine coded in JavaScript & jQuery.
In its current state, this engine only supports basic exploration-type text adventures along with simple object use. Check out the project website at http://velfi.github.io/adventure. I'm currently in the process of writing documentation. For some help on in-game commands, load the game up and type help.
