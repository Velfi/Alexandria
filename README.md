# Alexandria v1.0
### by Zelda Hessler
A browser based text adventure engine coded in JavaScript & jQuery.
In its current state, this engine only supports basic exploration-type text adventures along with simple object use. Check out the project website at http://velfi.github.io/adventure. I'm currently in the process of writing documentation. For some help on in-game commands, load the game up and type help.

### Getting it to work
I recommend hosting the page on a simple http webserver (npm install -g http-server) but it's also possible to play unhosted using FireFox. Currently, Chrome disallows some necessary functions for security reasons but that can be fixed by starting it in developer mode. The game won't work at all in I.E. or Edge. It is currently untested in Safari. I will work on this in the future.

### Current Features:
In its current state, this engine only supports basic exploration-type text adventures along with simple object use.

### Upcoming Features:
  * Taking objects & player inventory
  * NPCs and dialog
  * The ability to combine/use items together
  * Player input history
  * Saving and loading game progress
