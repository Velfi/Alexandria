{"name":"Alexandria","tagline":"A browser based text adventure engine.","body":"Alexandria is a text adventure engine the runs in a web browser. It's coded in JavaScript and jQuery and it reads from story files coded in JSON. This project is inspired by all the text adventures and MUDs I played as a kid.\r\n\r\nThe game uses a parser that accepts simple noun-verb phrases and turns them into commands. For the example:\r\n \r\n    >> take torch\r\n    You take the torch and place it in your pack.\r\n    >> examine torch\r\n    It is a simple thing comprised of an oil-soaked rag wrapped around a stick.\r\n\r\nYou can learn about each command by reading the in-game help screen (accessible at time entering the 'help' command.)\r\n\r\nIt's simple to write your own adventures.\r\nTo get started, check out the guide or start reading the full documentation.\r\n\r\nUpcoming features:\r\n+ A dialog system\r\n+ Player-triggered events","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
